Sample code for grid with a headered view

In the below screen shots, the first box (green with a white camera) is the header with a static image.  The rest of the boxes are images pulled from the camera roll of the phone.  Either of these two can be completely controlled through layouts.  The header can use MvvmCross bindings.
